================

This is a Shiny app to explore a National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) dataset in 
[ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/), and to use [fpp2](https://github.com/cran/fpp2) to make 
forecasts about air temperatures, based on historical data.

See [Shiny home](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for details on how to run the app.
